# Product Truth, QuickNote website

Every claim on the website maps to something the app actually does (source files referenced below live in the QuickNote app repo, `../QuickNote`). Use this
table when editing copy: if a feature isn't listed here, don't market it.

Legend: ✅ shipped in QuickNote 1.0 · ❌ do not claim

- ❌ iPhone / iPad / visionOS versions, macOS only.
- ❌ Tags, folders, wiki links, attachments, images, not implemented.
- ❌ Markdown export, printing, sharing extensions, not implemented.
- ❌ Encryption claims, storage is the system default; don't market security guarantees.
- ❌ Windows / Linux versions.
- ❌ Any pricing other than free (there is no payment flow).
- ❌ Notarized / "no warnings on open", currently false.

## Screenshot integrity

All screenshots in `assets/screenshots/` were captured from the real app via its
built-in snapshot driver with **curated demo notes only** (`-quicknote.demoData`
+ `-quicknote.inMemoryStore`), never real user data. Regenerate them with:

```
.build/DD/Build/Products/Debug/QuickNote.app/Contents/MacOS/QuickNote \
  -hasCompletedOnboarding 1 -quicknote.demoData -quicknote.inMemoryStore 1 \
  -quicknote.debugSnapshot
```

Output lands in the app's temporary directory (`quicknote-snapshots/`). See
`content/screenshots-MANIFEST.md` for what each file shows.
